# Video Game Sales Dashboard
This project explores the global video game industry by analyzing sales data across platforms, genres, and regions from 1980 to 2016. Using R and Tableau, I answer key questions about industry trends, top-performing games and genres, and regional preferences.

## Questions Answered
- How have global video game sales changed over time?
- What are the most successful video game genres and platforms?
- Which regions generate the most sales?
- Are there clear differences in game popularity across regions (e.g., Japan vs Europe)?
- Do critic or user scores influence sales?
- Which developers and publishers dominate the market?
